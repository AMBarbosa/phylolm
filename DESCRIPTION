Description: The package provides functions for fitting phylogenetic linear models and phylogenetic generalized linear models. The computation uses an algorithm that is linear in the number of tips in the tree. The package also provides functions for simulating continuous or binary traits along the tree, and other miscellaneous functions to test the adequacy of a population tree, etc.
